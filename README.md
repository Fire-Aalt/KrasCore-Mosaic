## Changelog
[1.4.0] - 2025-08-21 is out! 

### Added
**Tilemap Terrain**. A special terrain that merges multiple `IntGrid` layers into a single mesh using a custom TerrainShader and blending logic.

Full changelog can be found [here](CHANGELOG.md)

## Installation
Add these packages using git urls in a package manager:
1. KrasCore: https://github.com/Fire-Aalt/KrasCore.git
2. KrasCore.Mosaic: https://github.com/Fire-Aalt/KrasCore-Mosaic.git

Add these packages for optional support for runtime `IntGrid` debugging: 
1. BovineLabs.Core: https://gitlab.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.core.git
2. BovineLabs.Anchor: https://gitlab.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.anchor.git
3. BovineLabs.Quill: https://github.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.quill

## Workflow
### Editor (Single Grid workflow)
To start, we need 2 things: `IntGrid` and `RuleGroup` ScriptableObjects

Create IntGrid using "Create/Mosaic/IntGrid". This is how we can configure it:

![IntGrid](Documentation~/Images/IntGrid.png)
*You can add a texture to be displayed instead of a color. Use create RuleGroup button to quickly create RuleGroup ScriptableObject*

Open RuleGroup ScriptableObject and add some rules to it like this:
![RuleGroup](Documentation~/Images/RuleGroup.png)
*Every parameter has a tooltip*

To edit the rule pattern, click on the matrix of the rule matrix preview of the rule. This window will pop up:
![Rule](Documentation~/Images/Rule.png)
Here you can modify rule matrix pattern and add or remove results. All the results are weighted, where more weight means more chance to be selected. You can have both sprite and entity to be rendered/spawned.

Next add `GridAuthoring` component to a GameObject in a SubScene and add a `TilemapAuthoring` as a child to Grid. Configure them as needed.

### Editor (Dual-Grid workflow)

For Dual-Grid to work, a "Use Dual Grid" checkbox has to be ticked at the top of `IntGridDefinition`. This will change the serialized IntGriMatrix to Dual-Grid one and the authoring inspectors will also be changed for all the RuleGroups assign to that `IntGridDefinition`.

![DualGrid](Documentation~/Images/DualGrid.png)

### Tilemap Terrain
Works the same as having multiple `TilemapAuthoring` separately, but instead of multiple meshes produces only 1 using a custom shader for blending. 
![TilemapTerrainAuthoring.png](Documentation%7E/Images/TilemapTerrainAuthoring.png)

### Code
Reference to an `IntGrid`'s `IntGridHash` is required to send commands to `TilemapCommandBufferSystem`. Code is identical for both single grid and Dual-Grid configurations

1. Get a reference to `TilemapCommandBufferSingleton`
```csharp
var tcb = SystemAPI.GetSingleton<TilemapCommandBufferSingleton>();

// You can also set global seed here or do it later
tcb.SetGlobalSeed(seed);
```

2. Use `SetIntGridValue()` to update a referenced `IntGrid`
```csharp
// If you set 0 as IntGridValue you "remove" the position (the same as setting null value using SetTile in Unity.Tilemap)
tcb.SetIntGridValue(topWallsHash, new int2(0, 1), topWallsSolidIntGridValue);
```

3. Use `Clear()` to clear all IntGridValues of a specific `IntGrid` or use `ClearAll()` to clear all `IntGrid`s values
```csharp
tcb.Clear(topWalls);
tcb.ClearAll();
```

*Done!*

## How does RuleEngine work?
A matrix represents IntGridValues to search for with an offset from the center of every single position in the world. 
Controls and what they do are as follows:
1. Left click or "solid" color means that this cell must contain this exact IntGridValue
2. Right click or "canceled" color means that this cell can be anything but not this IntGridValue
3. Double right click removes the cell from cells to search (any IntGridValue is valid)
4. Any Value/No Value do the same as any other IntGridValues, but apply as a yes or no filter to the cell's IntGridValue (if IntGridValue = 1, and the cell is marked No Value, then the rule will not pass)

## Runtime debugging
A separate assembly is included with debug code. This assembly is conditionally compiled out if BovineLabs.Anchor and BovineLabs.Quill are not found in the project. Having BovineLabs.Anchor will add "Mosaic" toolbar to Anchor with a list of registered `IntGrid`s. Having BovineLabs.Quill will add runtime gizmo for selected `IntGrid`s in that list.
